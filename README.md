CONTENT

This repository contains the code used for the analysis of relations between social values and urban canopy cover. The social value data was established through a PPGIS survey as part of the co-carbon project. The specific data contains information on Copenhagen, DK, and Helsinki, FI. The urban canopy cover data is publically available data from the Copernicus Landuse Monitoring.

The PPGIS social value data is not publically available and can only be accessed after prior agreement with the Co-Carbon project, the University of Copenhagen, and the University of Helsinki (or official and entitled representatives of each entity). 

The urban canopy cover data can be downloaded from: INSERT LINK


INSTRUCTION TO USE THE CODES

Each code has a number assigned to it. This number indicates the order in which the codes are designed to run. It is important to note that each individual code leads to outputs necessary for the next code. Hence it is important to run each code in sequence and to properly store and access each created data subset.

If you have any questions about using the code, feel free to contact me. Please note, that I myself am NOT ENTITLED to provide access to the PPGIS data.
